/* using System.out
to write to the console is acceptable
for small programs and debugging purposes

For real-world programs, the recommended method of
writing to the console when using Java is
through a PrintWriter stream.

PrintWriter is one of the character-based classes.
Using a character-based class for console output
makes internationalizing your program easier

PrintWriter supports the print( ) and println( ) methods

the following program illustrates using the PrintWriter to handle console Output

        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out,true));
        pw.println("This is a string");
        int i = -7;
        pw.println(i);
        double d = 4.5e-7;
        pw.println(d);
