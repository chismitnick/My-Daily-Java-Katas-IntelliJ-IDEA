// An enumeration is a list of named constants
//in Java, an enumeration defines a class type
//by making enumerations into classes, the capabilities of the enumeration are greatly expanded
//enumeration can have constructors, methods, and instance variables
//enumeration constants implicitly declared as a public, static final members of Fruit
//their type is the type of the enumeration in which they are declared
//these constants are called self-typed, in which “self” refers to the
//enclosing enumeration
